    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    Past few years have witnessed tremendous progress in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies including but not limited to natural language processing (NLP), metaverse, and generative models. These changes mark a new era with large language models (LLMs) like generative pre-trained transformers such as the GPT-3, GPT-4, and Llama2 gaining importance. These models, trained on vast text data, generate human-like text and find use in content creation, Q & A systems, and chatbots. Machine learning advances enable models like ChatGPT to respond to real-time text prompts. However, they are vulnerable to attacks, leading to inaccurate or harmful content. Adversarial prompting addresses these issues, including input manipulation, creating inducive prompts which causes LLMs to produce illegal content, simulating violence and harm, privacy breaches and other illegitimate actions. LLMs are especially prone to text attacks, with minor changes resulting in different outputs. Researchers are improving model security through adversarial training. To enhance the security of LLMs and prevent them from responding to adversarial prompts, we aim to utilize machine learning, deep learning and transformer models as external prompt classifiers for LLM-based applications like ChatGPT, to detect and counter malicious prompts that may lead to inappropriate responses from LLMs. We have conducted analyses on multiple machine learning, deep learning, and Transformer-based models, incorporating techniques such as ensembling and attention mechanisms. These models are trained on word-level text classification to categorize prompts into the adversarial category, preventing them from being answered by LLMs. We compared our results with those of other ML and DL models, and our proposed ensemble of the BERT-DistilBERT model achieved the best outcome with 97.56% accuracy in identifying malicious/adversarial prompts.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    Recently, machine learning models have become a key methodology in detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This gives medical practitioners diagnostic support and indicators. In this work, we compare various machine learning (ML) classification algorithms, apply them to disease dataset and examine how these algorithms perform when subjected to either of the classes to aid in the study and investigation of CVD through computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Our two main goals in this work are to first offer an automated machine learning ensemble model for categorizing cardiovascular malignancies and second to compare the performance of several classification algorithms to find the best classifier for the task. The proposed technique is specifically developed as a potential support for clinical care based on patient diagnostic data. The proposed approach exhibits an accuracy of 94.28% in the detection of cardiac illnesses when a thorough examination of binary classification is performed and averaged over numerous model training iterations. We believe that incorporating the suggested ensemble methods would produce stable and dependable CAD systems.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    Spear-phishing emails are an effective cyber-attack method due to the fact that the emails sent are highly personalized to look like a regular legitimate email. Recently, it was discovered that personality traits of the victim have an impact on a person's susceptibility to spear-phishing. This study aims to identify which personality traits affect spear-phishing susceptibility besides other traits such as Information Technology background, gender, and age. In addition, measure of the effectiveness of embedded training systems and see whether message framing can further help increase its effectiveness. A personality trait survey was sent to 100 participants, followed by a real-life spear-phishing simulation to measure a certain personality traitâ€™s influence on phishing susceptibility. After a two-week period, the second round of spear-phishing emails was sent again to measure message framing effectiveness. The personality traits analysis results show that users with higher levels of Internet anxiety are less susceptible to spear-phishing emails. While the message framing did not show any significant results, the embedded training program reduced the click rate. Findings revealed that certain people are more susceptible to spear-phishing emails than others. Thus, this work can guide an institution or organizations to identify which group of people are more vulnerable to spear-phishing.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    The evolution of industry has been significantly influenced by blockchain technology. Regarding security, data access, auditing, and transaction management inside digital platforms, blockchain decentralized technology and privacy protocols offer potential benefits to many businesses. Blockchain is based on distributed and secure decentralized protocols; there is no central authority or point of control, and the network's nodes themselves generate, add, and validate the data blocks. Finally, Blockchains enable transparency by allowing each participant to observe transactions at any moment. Smart contracts provide secure transactions, reducing the risk of third-party disruption. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that facilitates the execution of smart contracts. This allows developers to design markets that move funds in accordance with instructions issued years ago. Decentralization and immutability are the principal characteristics of blockchain. Faster transactions, transaction and validation in seconds, and so forth. The security and applications of blockchain technology with brief introduction is discussed in this study. We can draw conclusion from this chapter article that there are security concerns with blockchain technology. These security concerns ought to have an impact on transactions as well. Blockchain technology offers some protection against certain attacks and also provides solutions to these problems.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    Cobots, or collaborative robots, have significantly increased productivity and efficiency across a number of industries. Cobots exist alongside humans and interact with crucial systems, but this growing reliance on them also poses security issues. By recognising and thwarting potential security threats and attacks, adversarial learning, a branch of machine learning, has emerged as a promising method to improve the security of Cobots. This chapter explores the use of adversarial learning in Cobot-driven sectors with a focus on identifying and reducing security vulnerabilities. We investigate different adversarial learning methods, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adversarial training, and their potential uses in Cobot security. This chapter also explores how adversarial learning is used in Cobot-driven sectors, with a focus on identifying and reducing security vulnerabilities. The chapter also examines computational cost and scalability as well as other drawbacks of adversarial learning in this setting. To solve these issues and establish a secure environment for Cobots in industrial settings, we also propose prospective future research trends and advancements. The goal of this chapter is to support the trustworthy and safe integration of Cobots., ensuring human safety and encouraging the continuous expansion of Cobot-driven enterprises by understanding and utilising adversarial learning to minimise security threats.

    <strong>Abstract: </strong>  
    Breast Cancer is the leading form of cancer found in women and a major cause of increased mortality rates among them. However, manual diagnosis of the disease is time-consuming and often limited by the availability of screening systems. Thus, there is a pressing need for an automatic diagnosis system that can quickly detect cancer in its early stages. Data mining and machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools in developing such a system. In this study we investigated the performance of several machine learning models on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) dataset with a particular emphasis on finding which models perform the best for breast cancer diagnosis. The study also explores the contrast between the proposed ANN methodology and conventional machine learning techniques. The comparison between the methods employed in the current study and those utilized in earlier research on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is also compared. The findings of this study are in line with those of previous studies which also highlighted the efficacy of SVM, Decision Tree, CART, ANN, and ELM ANN for breast cancer detection. Several classifiers achieved high accuracy, precision and F1 scores for benign and malignant tumours, respectively. It is also found that models with hyperparameter adjustment performed better than those without and boosting methods like as XGBoost, Adaboost, and Gradient Boost consistently performed well across benign and malignant tumours. The study emphasizes the significance of hyperparameter tuning and the efficacy of boosting algorithms in addressing the complexity and nonlinearity of data. Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) dataset, a detailed summary of the current status of research on breast cancer diagnosis is provided.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has extended across various facets of human existence, leading
    to a significant loss of life and overwhelming medical resources. Furthermore, the global economy has suffered
    considerably due to widespread job losses and decline, resulting in severe financial disturbances. Multiple section
    of society have made varied contributions to curb the virusâ€™s propagation and safeguard public health. Notably,
    approval has been directed towards medical researchers for their dedicated endeavours in crafting COVID-19 vaccines. 
    Rigorous clinical testing has confirmed the remarkable efficacy of these vaccines in mitigating symptomatic
    COVID-19 occurrences. However, a notable portion of the global population has exhibited reluctance towards
    receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. This reluctance stems from misconceptions surrounding the vaccines, a trend
    that has been exacerbated through a confluence of factors, encompassing the unrestricted access to internet-based
    information and the influential effect wielded by prominent personalities and authoritative figures. In this study,
    we have conducted an evaluation of responses furnished by the ChatGPT system concerning inquiries pertinent
    to vaccine fallacies. The affirmative and helpful perspectives expressed by the chatbot could potentially assume a
    pivotal role in moulding individualsâ€™ outlooks on vaccinations. Additionally, these responses have the capacity to
    effectively motivate users to adapt vaccination, effectively minimizing prevalent misconceptions.

  <div class="abstract-box" style="border: 1px dashed white; padding: 5px; display: none; margin-top: 5px;">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    In recent years, advancements in healthcare technology, such as the rise of machine learning (ML),
    deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI), have sparked widespread interest due to their potential
    to improve survival rates and enhance people's health. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common
    neurodegenerative and dementing illness, is a major concern, with the cost of caring for patients expected
    to rise dramatically. Hence, the need for a computer-aided system to detect AD early and accurately is
    becoming crucial. Deep learning algorithms have proven to be more effective than traditional ML methods,
    as demonstrated by studies using brain MRI scans and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the
    diagnosis of AD. In the field of biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging,
    predictive modelling and pattern recognition using ML and DL techniques have become essential for
    gaining a deeper understanding of complex medical problems. In this study, we compared various deep
    learning models for classifying four dementia stages related to AD by using transfer learning. The aim of
    classifying this type of medical data is to develop a prediction model or system to identify the disease from
    normal subjects or determine the stage of the disease. Classifying clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease
    (AD) has long posed a challenge, particularly in terms of selecting the most effective features. Our study
    successfully utilized various pretrained models, including EfficientNetB7, VGG, DenseNet, and others, to
    classify a dataset based on OASIS I and II extracted from Kaggle into Alzheimer's patients and normal
    controls. Our results showed an accuracy of 97.88% on test data using the EfficientNetB7 model. This
    experiment shows that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by pretrained models on large
    datasets, followed by deep learning classification, using the approach of transfer learning, is the most
    powerful method for distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in MRI. This approach also provides a
    path for predicting more complex systems in future.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    This study introduces an original comprehensive system centered on identifying specific terms that indicate a user's position, particularly the discrete values representing latitude and longitude. This system not only detects these terms but also retrieves the corresponding numerical data for accurate and efficient determination of locations. The importance of this study can be applied various fields, notably aiding offline operations of military personnel, who often lack internet access. In such scenarios, precise awareness of location is vital for strategic manoeuvres, rescue operations, and navigating unfamiliar landscapes. The system allows these personnel by allowing them to extract exact location coordinates from spoken terms, thereby enhancing their awareness even in challenging surroundings. Apart from its military utility, the project holds broader significance. Teams responding to emergencies, personnel involved in disaster management, and exploratory missions can all gain from this technology during disruptions in communication infrastructure. Furthermore, travelers, adventurers, and outdoor enthusiasts can utilize this system to accurately determine their positions in remote areas without relying on online maps. We used offline speech recognition techniques to precisely transcribe spoken terms, achieving an accuracy of over 91.3% and a word error rate of 4.2%. For sound recognition, the OpenAI Whisper model was used, and a conversion process from SpeechRecognition to AudioSegmentation was implemented, followed by transforming the audio into .wav format, we have also developed the interface of the app to use it efficiently using Streamlit. This was done to ensure seamless compatibility with the Whisper model and uninterrupted audio input. By training the system to identify specific linguistic linked to location, it achieves robust detection and extraction of relevant terms. This approach eliminates the necessity for constant internet connectivity, rendering it exceptionally useful in remote, offline, and resource-limited situations.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
    High levels of air pollutants pose significant health risks, increasing the chances of respiratory infections, lung cancer, and heart complications, particularly for those already susceptible to illness. Modern societal advancements have worsened air quality degradation, with daily activities such as transportation, industrial processes, and domestic operations releasing harmful contaminants. This study addresses the urgent need for air quality monitoring and forecasting, especially in developing nations like India, where machine learning-based prediction technologies play a crucial role in understanding environmental aspects. Our study focuses on analyzing and predicting air quality using data from two distinct areas in Kolkataâ€”Victoria and Rabindra. Thorough pre-processing and data analysis have been conducted to identify essential features and detect undermining patterns in the data. Utilizing five classic machine learning algorithms, we predict the air quality category by categorizing the predicted AQI into six AQI classes, emphasizing extensive hyper-parameter tuning for each model. The Rabindra dataset yields the best-performing Support Vector Machine (SVC) model with a 97.98% accuracy, while the best prediction accuracy for Victoria location is 93.29% from Random Forest Classifier (RFC). This study offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for air quality prediction, with the novelty of the study lying in the focus on hyper-parameter tuning to achieve the highest accuracy.
